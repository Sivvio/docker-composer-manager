# katsu-script-manager
A simple automation tool that allows scripts to be configured and executed based on HTTP events.

## Motivation
We wanted to make our daily deployment process into development environments smoother and without manual intervention. We do love shell-scripting (and have tons of scripts), but managing these by hand based on various events still require too much manual intervention, therefore we  needed a tool that could capture these events (generally coming from the CI system), react to them based on the pre defined configuration, and perform the job.

Our mantra is: *Focus on the solution, not in the tooling*.

### Origin of the name
The name was inspired by the team's favorite meal: The famous chicken katsu by ***** (venue's name ommited since they are not paying anything to us neither giving us free meals!).
